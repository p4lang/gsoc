## Project description

The general idea is to improve documentation for the reference P4 compiler project (P4C) by building a central documentation site. Currently we have several markdown files and slides in the repo serving as the main documentation. For a seasoned contributor to P4C, these documents contain valuable information, and they know how to navigate them. But for a new contributor, the organization of these documents can be confusing. This is a situation we wish to improve with this project.

## Expected outcomes

- Minimal outcome (Easy + 90 hour): Set up the documentation site infrastructure, and migrate existing documents there with an improved organization.
- Extended outcome (Medium + 175 hour / 350 hour): Besides minimal outcome, also improve our documentation contents. This would require good technical writing skills, and a deeper knowledge of the P4C project itself.

## Resources

- The P4C repo to build documentation site for:
  - https://github.com/p4lang/p4c
- Current documentation locations:
  - https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/main/README.md
  - https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/tree/main/docs
- Potentially relevant projects:
  - https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials
    - We can consider whether to also include this tutorial as part of the P4C documentation site.
- Some language/compiler project documentation sites to draw inspirations from:
  - https://tvm.apache.org/docs/
  - https://mlir.llvm.org/
  - https://triton-lang.org/
