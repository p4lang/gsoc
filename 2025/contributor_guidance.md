# P4 GSoC 2025 Contributor Guidance

## Application process

- Go through the general GSoC
  [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq),
  [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), and
  [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student).
- Check out our
  [organization profile]() and
  [ideas list](ideas_list.md)
  to see if they fit your interests and skills.
- **February 27 - March 24**
  - We encourage you to reach out to mentors of your interested projects as early as possible, so we have enough time to know about you and connect with you.
  - Bringing your own project idea is also welcomed. In this case, send an email to Bili and Fabian (find their emails from the ideas list), and they’ll help you connect with potential mentors.
- **March 24 - April 8 (18:00 UTC)**
  - Before the formal application, make sure you have communicated with project mentors through emails already.
  - Apply through the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).
  - For proposal writing, check out the template below.
- **May 8 (18:00 UTC)**
  - Accepted GSoC contributor projects will be announced.
- In your **first email to project mentors**, please attach a **draft proposal** (see the template below).
  - If the application is already open, you can submit this draft proposal on the GSoC website directly, and mention this in your email.
  - You don’t need to wait until finishing the qualification task before sending the first email. That part is only required for your formal application.
