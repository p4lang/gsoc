### <a name='project-1'></a> Project 1: Integrate p4-constraints frontend into P4C [⤴️](#index)

**Basic info**

![diffi-easy] ![size-s]

- Potential mentors
  - Primary: Matthew Lam
  - Support: Jonathan DiLorenzo, Fabian Ruffy
- Skills
  - Required: Git, C++
  - Preferred: CMake, Bazel, [P4C](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c)
- Discussion thread: TBD

**Project description**

[p4-constraints](https://github.com/p4lang/p4-constraints) is a useful extension of the P4 programming language that is currently architected as a standalone library separate from the P4 compiler, P4C.

<img width="757" alt="image" src="../2024/assets/p4_constraints.png">

The goal of this project is to integrate the p4-constraints frontend, which parses and type checks the constraint annotations, into the P4C frontend. This architecture change provides the following benefits:

- For P4 programmers: Immediate feedback about syntax or type errors in constraints during P4 compilation.
- For P4C backend developers: Easy consumption of the parsed & type-checked constraints.

[P4TestGen](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/p4testgen.pdf) is a concrete example of a P4C backend that needs to consume p4-constraints to work correctly, and it currently does this by implementing its own p4-constraints frontend, which is brittle and requires duplication of work for new p4-constraint features.

**Expected outcomes**

- The p4-constraints frontend becomes part of P4C.

### <a name='project-2'></a> Project 2: BMv2 packet trace support [⤴️](#index)

**Basic info**

![diffi-medium] ![size-m]

- Potential mentors
  - Primary: Matthew Lam
  - Support: Jonathan DiLorenzo, Bili Dong
- Skills
  - Required: Git, C++
  - Preferred: P4
- Discussion thread: TBD

**Project description**

Having programmatic access to the trace of a packet going through a P4 pipeline (e.g. applied tables, actions, entries hit, etc) has many use cases from human comprehension to use by automated tools for test coverage measurement, automated test generation, automated root causing, etc.

BMv2 currently does provide textual logs that can be used to manually track the packet as it goes through the pipeline. However there is no API to access the trace in a more structured and programmatic form (i.e. in a way that can potentially be digested by other tools).

The goal of this project is to provide a mechanism for BMv2 to record the trace and provide it to the user in a structured format.

**Expected outcomes**

- Structured packet trace outputs supported in BMv2.

**Resources**

- BMv2: https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model

### <a name='project-3'></a> Project 3: BMv2 with all possible output packets [⤴️](#index)

**Basic info**

![diffi-hard] ![size-m]

- Potential mentors
  - Primary: Matthew Lam
  - Support: Jonathan DiLorenzo, Bili Dong
- Skills
  - Required: Git, C++
  - Preferred: P4
- Discussion thread: TBD

**Project description**

There are many situations where it is more useful to have all possible outputs from a P4 simulation rather than only a single one. For example, we use this for diff testing, to determine whether the switch is doing something correct or something incorrect.

Multiple allowed behaviors usually arise from various multi-path constructs (e.g. ECMP, WCMP, or perhaps LAGs) usually modeled as action profiles in P4. BMv2 currently allows users to set a mode determining action profile behavior, like `round robin` which means that every time you send in the same packet, it should result in the next possible outcome (eventually wrapping around).

The goal of this project is to provide a new mode for BMv2 to instead output ALL possible behaviors. This will both require extending the action profile modes, and likely extending the notion of output from a set of packets to a set of sets of packets.

**Expected outcomes**

- BMv2 has a modality where every possible outcome is generated instead of one possible outcome.
- Must interact correctly with multicast and punting.

**Resources**

- BMv2: https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model

  - Any personal project that incorporates P4.

**Project description**

[Katran](https://github.com/facebookincubator/katran) is designed to build a high-performance load balancer based on C and eBPF. The P4 open-source compiler, [P4C](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c), supports eBPF as one of its possible targets. This allows a P4 program to be converted into an eBPF program for packet processing. The maintenance of the eBPF backend relies on simple examples that are used to test the backend. The lack of complex programs makes developing and evaluating new features, as well as identifying regressions, more challenging.

Finalize the implementation of Katran in P4 helps provide a complex program example imporve the test coverage of eBPF backend. Due to that possible bugs can be identifed and fixd together with new features can be implemented.

**Expected outcomes**

- Document and complete the P4 implementation of Katran.
- Identify and/or resolve bugs in the P4C eBPF backend.
- If needed, update the P4C eBPF backend documentation.

- Make sure your contributions could demonstrate your knowledge of MLIR concepts & internals.

**Project description**

P4C, being a reference compiler for the P4 language, struggles with some fundamental shortcomings of its internal code representation (IR). These issues result in increased running time of the compiler itself as well as unacceptable memory consumption of certain compiler passes.

Since these problems lie at the foundation of the present IR, as an alternative to just fixing them (that would require some redesign of the IR and would require some invasive changes in the compiler codebase) we are aiming to explore alternative solutions that might at the same time open more opportunities for future growth and expansion of the compiler. One of such possibilities is to explore the adoption of the results of MLIR project to be used within P4C.

In particular, we aim to develop a P4-specific MLIR dialect (`P4HIR`) that would allow reuse the infrastructure, code analysis, and transformation passes that have recently been developed within MLIR framework.

Since [P4MLIR](https://github.com/p4lang/p4mlir) is a moving target, the precise set of tasks within this project is TBD at the time of project proposal submission. This might include (but not limited to):

- Implementation of certain dialect operations corresponding to P4 constructs
- Implementation of some dialect interfaces allowing high-level transformations (e.g. Mem2Reg, SROA, data flow analyses)
- Reimplementation of P4C frontend / midend passes in MLIR
- Lowering to P4 high-level dialect to lower-level constructs:
  - Perform CFG flattening
  - Lowering to [`llvm`](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/LLVM/) and / or [`emitc`](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/EmitC/) dialects
  - ...
- Implementing control plane metadata emission out of `P4HIR`

The exact list of tasks is to be determined with mentors.

**Expected outcomes**

- Implementation of the mentioned `P4HIR` advancements
- Document the changes made

**Project description**

[BMv2](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) is a popular software simulator target for P4. In our current open source P4 compiler [P4C](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c), when targeting BMv2, a P4 program is converted to a JSON file, which BMv2 uses as a specification for processing packets. In [P4MLIR](https://github.com/p4lang/p4mlir), we plan to add a dialect specifically for modeling [BMv2 JSON primitives](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/main/docs/JSON_format.md), so that the BMv2 dialect -> BMv2 JSON transformation could be straightforward.

In the longer term, we expect a compilation path like P4C frontend -> P4HIR dialect -> BMv2 dialect -> BMv2 JSON. For this GSoC project, we will concentrate on implementing a subset of BMv2 JSON primitives in the BMv2 dialect, and implementing the corresponding BMv2 dialect -> BMv2 JSON transformation.

**Expected outcomes**

- A subset of BMv2 JSON primitives are defined in the BMv2 dialect.
- The BMv2 dialect -> BMv2 JSON transformation works for this subset of primitives.
