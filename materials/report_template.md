## Abstract
An effective abstract is a short and clear summary of your report (usually 1–2 paragraphs) that helps readers quickly understand the main ideas without having to read the whole text[[1]](#1-https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/authors/writing-an-effective-abstract). It should:
- Include key terms related to your topic.
- Use clear, accessible language, with minimal unexplained technical jargon.
- Highlight the most interesting and important aspects of your work immediately.

## Implementation Details
It contains a detailed explanation of the work implemented during the GSoC period.
More specifically, it provides the technical description of what has been done; the student may use images, code snippets, and similar material to support the explanation.
For particularly complex or large tasks, subsections can be used to describe each task in detail. Each subsection should reference the relevant PRs and, when useful, include images, code snippets,etc.

## Demo
This section provides the information required to compile, configure, and run the GSoC project. All necessary commands have to be listed and accompanied by a short description. Images showing the results should also be included and explained to demonstrate the obtained outcomes and to showcase that the implementation is functioning correctly.

## Results
In this section, the obtained results, such as implemented features, applications, tools, or measurements, have to be presented and discussed. More specifically, for work focused exclusively on software development, the completed objectives should be described and highlighted, while for measurements, graphs can be used to present the evaluated data together with comments that analyse and discuss the results.

## Future Work
Future work aims to provide an overview of possible improvements or enhancements to the developed GSoC project. In other words, it should give the reader a clear view of additional functionalities or possible improvements that could be implemented.
