## Abstract
An effective abstract is a short and clear summary of your paper (usually 1–2 paragraphs) that helps readers quickly understand the main ideas without having to read the whole text[[1]](#1-https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/authors/writing-an-effective-abstract). It should:
- Include key terms related to your topic.
- Use clear, accessible language, with minimal unexplained technical jargon.
- Highlight the most interesting and important aspects of your work immediately.

## Implementation details
This section contains a detailed explanation of the work implemented during the GSoC period.
More specifically, the Implementation details section provides the technical description of what has been done; the student may use images, code snippets, and similar material to support the explanation.
For particularly complex or large tasks, subsections can be used to describe each task in detail. Each subsection should reference the relevant PRs and, when useful, include images, code snippets,etc.

## Demo
This section provides the information required to compile, configure, and run the GSoC project. All necessary commands have to be listed and accompanied by a short description. Images showing the results should also be included and explained to demonstrate the obtained outcomes and to showcase that the implementation is functioning correctly.
