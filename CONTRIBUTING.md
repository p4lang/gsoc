# Contribute to the P4 GSoC Repository

Thank you for considering contributing to the P4 GSoC (Google Summer of Code) repository! Your contributions are valuable and help improve this repository for everyone. Before getting started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

We follow [P4C's guidelines](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in general. As this repository is mostly documentation, our guidelines are much simpler.

## Contributing License

The P4 organization uses [DCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) for contributions. Please take a look at our [guidelines](https://github.com/p4lang/governance/wiki/P4-DCO-Guidelines).

To sign off the last commit quickly, use the `git commit --amend --signoff` command. The failing check will also include instructions on how to sign off all commits in two steps (using `git rebase HEAD~$NUM_COMMITS --signoff`). The [Developer Community DCO guide](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md#dco-is-missing) also provides helpful tips on fixing DCO inconveniences. Setting up a commit hook in this repository will automate adding the DCO signoff.
