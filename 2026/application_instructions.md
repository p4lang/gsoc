# P4 GSoC 2026 Contributor Guidance

## Before the Application

- Go through the general GSoC
  [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq),
  [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), and
  [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student).
- Check out our
  [organization profile](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations/the-p4-language-consortium),
  [learning materials](/materials/learning_materials.md),
  [contributor guidance](/materials/lcontributor_guidance.md), which are mandatory for all contributors, and the
  [ideas list](ideas_list.md)
  to see if they fit your interests and skills.

## Application Process

1. Email mentors (both primary and support) of your interested projects.
   - You only need to email mentors whose emails are listed.
   - We encourage you to reach out to mentors as early as possible, so we have enough time to know about you and connect with you.
   - **In your first email to mentors, please attach a draft proposal (see template below).** It doesn't have to be complete. But we expect to see a draft so we can start the conversation, and help you polish it.
2. Apply through the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).
   - Before submitting your formal application, make sure you have communicated with mentors through emails already.
3. Wait for your application result.

## Proposal Template

- Please follow this
  [guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)
  and use these examples ([1](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/proposal-example-1) &
  [2](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/proposal-example-2)) as reference.
- The proposal structure is up to you to decide, but make sure it contains the following elements as mentioned in the guide, with a few additional notes:
  - **Name and Contact Information**
    - Please also include a link to your GitHub profile.
  - **Title**
  - **Synopsis**
  - **Benefits to Community**
  - **Deliverables**
  - **Related Work**
  - **Biographical Information**
    - Please structure this section as a typical 1-page CV/resume.
    - If you have any prior open source contribution, or P4 related experience, make sure you list and emphasize them in this section.
  - **Questionnaire**
    - Please include your answers to the following questions:
      - Why are you interested in our organization?
      - Why are you interested in this particular project?
      - What makes you a good candidate to work on this project?
      - What do you expect to get out of this GSoC program?
  - **Qualification Task**
    - The qualification task is to make a pull request in one of the following repos:
      - https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials
      - https://github.com/p4lang/p4c
    - It's suggested to check out existing issues for inspirations, but your pull request could be anything meaningful.
    - Please read [this guide](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/get-started/write_a_good_pr) on how to write a good pull request first.
    - The pull request doesn’t have to be merged for the qualification task to be considered complete. But if you can manage to get it merged, that’s a bonus point for your application.
    - Please attach the link to your pull request in the proposal.
