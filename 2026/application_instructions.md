# P4 GSoC 2026 Application instructions

## Before the Application

- Go through the general GSoC
  [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq),
  [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), and
  [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student).
- Check out our
  [organization profile](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026/organizations/the-p4-language-consortium),
  [learning materials](/README.md),
  [contributor guidance](/materials/contributor_guidance.md), which are mandatory for all contributors, and the
  [ideas list](ideas_list.md)
  to see if they fit your interests and skills.

## Application Process

1. Email mentors (both primary and support) of your interested projects.
   - You only need to email mentors whose emails are listed.
   - We encourage you to reach out to mentors as early as possible, so we have enough time to know about you and connect with you.
   - **In your first email to mentors, please attach a draft proposal (see template below).** It doesn't have to be complete. But we expect to see a draft so we can start the conversation, and help you polish it.
2. Apply through the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).
   - Before submitting your formal application, make sure you have communicated with mentors through emails already.
3. Wait for your application result.

## Use of AI to write the proposal
The use of AI tools as an aid during proposal preparation is allowed. Applicants may use AI to help improve written English, generate figures, and support preliminary research necessary to understand the problem space. The generation, fabrication, or manipulation of data using AI tools to strengthen a proposal—for example, to produce tables, graphs, diagrams, or similar materials—is not permitted.

However, proposals must reflect the applicant’s own original work and understanding. Submissions that are wholly or substantially generated by AI are not acceptable. The P4 Consortium reserves the right to reject any proposal that, in the judgment of its admins and/or mentors, does not demonstrate sufficient original authorship by the applicant.

## Proposal Template

- Please follow this
  [guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)

- The proposal structure is up to you to decide, but make sure it contains the following elements as mentioned in the guide, with a few additional notes:
  - **Name and Contact Information**
    - Please also include a link to your GitHub profile.
  - **Title**
  - **Synopsis**
  - **Benefits to Community**
  - **Deliverables**
  - **Related Work**
  - **Biographical Information**
    - Please structure this section as a typical 1-page CV/resume.
    - If you have any prior open source contribution, or P4 related experience, make sure you list and emphasize them in this section.
  - **Questionnaire**
    - Please include your answers to the following questions:
      - Why are you interested in our organization?
      - Why are you interested in this particular project?
      - What makes you a good candidate to work on this project?
      - What do you expect to get out of this GSoC program?
  - **Qualification Task**
    - The qualification task is to submit one or more pull requests to one of the following:
      - Any of the repositories under the [P4 Language Organization](https://github.com/p4lang), such as [P4C](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c), [Tutorials](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials), [BMv2](https://github.com/p4lang/behavorial-model), [P4Runtime](https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime), etc.
      - Implement one of the project ideas proposed in https://github.com/p4lang/project-ideas/issues.
      - Specific qualification tasks provided by mentors for a given project, defined during the     application period.
    - It's suggested to check out existing issues for inspirations, but your pull request could be anything meaningful.
    - Please read [this guide](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/get-started/write_a_good_pr) on how to write a good pull request first.
    - The pull request doesn’t have to be merged for the qualification task to be considered complete. But if you can manage to get it merged, that’s a bonus point for your application.
    - Please attach the link to your pull request in the proposal.
