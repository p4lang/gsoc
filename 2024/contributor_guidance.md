# P4 GSoC 2024 Contributor Guidance

## Application process

- Go through the general GSoC
  [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq),
  [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), and
  [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student).
- Check out our
  [organization profile](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/the-p4-language-consortium),
  [learning materials](/materials/learning_materials.md), and
  [ideas list](ideas_list.md)
  to see if they fit your interests and skills.
- **February 22 - March 18**
  - We encourage you to reach out to mentors of your interested projects as early as possible, so we have enough time to know about you and connect with you.
  - Bringing your own project idea is also welcomed. In this case, send an email to Bili and Fabian (find their emails from the ideas list), and they’ll help you connect with potential mentors.
- **March 18 - April 2 (18:00 UTC)**
  - Before the formal application, make sure you have communicated with project mentors through emails already.
  - Apply through the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).
  - For proposal writing, check out the template below.
- **May 1 (18:00 UTC)**
  - Accepted GSoC contributor projects will be announced.
- In your **first email to project mentors**, please attach a **draft proposal** (see the template below).
  - If the application is already open, you can submit this draft proposal on the GSoC website directly, and mention this in your email.
  - You don’t need to wait until finishing the qualification task before sending the first email. That part is only required for your formal application.
  - Questions are welcomed. Don't be afraid to ask.

## Proposal template

  [guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)

    - Please also include your GitHub username.
  - **Title**
  - **Synopsis**

      - What makes you a good candidate to work on this project?
      - What do you expect to get out of this GSoC program?
  - **Qualification Task**
    - The qualification task is to make a pull request in one of the following repos:
      - https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials
      - https://github.com/p4lang/p4c
        - Only choose this one if your interested project is related to p4c.
    - Please read [this guide](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/get-started/write_a_good_pr) on how to write a good pull request first.
    - You can identify any issue or place of improvement to work on by yourself.
    - Or check out the following labels for beginner-friendly issues:
      - https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/labels/help%20wanted
      - https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/labels/good-first-issue
    - The pull request doesn’t have to be merged for the qualification task to be considered complete. But if you can manage to get it merged, that’s a bonus point for your application.
    - Please attach the link to your pull request.
